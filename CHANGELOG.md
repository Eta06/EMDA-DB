# Changelog

Notable changes are recorded here. See [the versioning policy](docs/VERSIONING.md) for release and compatibility rules.

## [Unreleased]

The package version is currently `0.1.0`, but no version has been tagged or published yet.

### Added

- An experimental Rust key-value engine with `put`, `get`, and `delete` operations.
- Checksummed append records, synchronized writes, reopen recovery, and a single-process ownership lock.
- Concurrent-reader and serialized-writer coordination, plus tests for corruption, incomplete records, and abrupt process termination.
- GitHub Actions checks for formatting, linting, and tests on the minimum supported Rust version and stable.
- Architecture notes, a competitor feature inventory, a benchmark plan, and a prioritized roadmap.
- An attribution and notices file, versioning policy, and automated GitHub release workflow.
- A regression test that rejects unknown on-disk record versions without modifying the log.
- Instructions for trying the Apache-licensed Rust library from a Git dependency.
- A storage and transaction contract distinguishing current behavior from proposed guarantees, with a rule against optimizations that violate durability, isolation, or recovery.
- A README progress view and a prioritized assessment of proposed performance and database features.
- Design goals for safe project scale-to-zero, including draining, recovery, ownership, and cold-start testing.
- Project isolation threat boundaries, proposed protection layers and tiers, and validation requirements.
- Initial deterministic fault injection for partial appends, simulated disk-full/sync failures, short reads, writer panics, and controlled concurrency.
- Experimental checksummed full-log backup/restore that refuses to overwrite existing destinations.
- A local closed-loop key-value benchmark harness for the prototype and bundled SQLite; it is a narrow baseline, not a general performance ranking.
- Raw results and environment details for an initial small SQLite comparison.
- Benchmark p99.9, maximum, and per-client latency reporting to expose rare stalls and skew.

### Changed

- Incomplete log tails and a missing log for an existing store now fail closed without silently truncating or recreating the log.
- Readers can continue using the previous indexed value while a writer synchronizes; successful mutations still sync before becoming visible and returning.
- Store initialization synchronizes the created directory path and ancestors; power-loss behavior is not yet proven.

### Limitations

- This is a prototype, not a production database. SQL, document queries, multi-key transactions, compaction, bounded index memory, network access, and distributed features are not implemented. Backup files are unencrypted and retain deleted historical values.
