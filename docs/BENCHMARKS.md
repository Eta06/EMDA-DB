# Benchmark plan

An initial local SQLite comparison harness exists; no general competitive performance claim has been established. The goal is to improve latency, throughput, scalability, and resource efficiency. **No performance optimization is accepted if it violates the durability, isolation, or recovery guarantees in force.** See the [storage and transaction contract](STORAGE_TRANSACTION_CONTRACT.md). No database can be assumed fastest at every operation or workload.

## Initial local harness

Run the Rust prototype and bundled SQLite through the same small, single-process harness. Both use byte keys, 64-byte values, and per-value CRC checks. Prototype mutations call `sync_data`; SQLite uses WAL, `synchronous=FULL`, autocommit, cached statements, and a 30-second busy timeout. These are not identical internal implementations or complete durability guarantees. The prototype verifies log records; SQLite has a different storage format and verification behavior.

```sh
# Arguments: backend, clients, operations/client, keys, write %, existing directory.
cargo run --release --locked --example kv_bench -- prototype 4 250 250 50 .
cargo run --release --locked --example kv_bench -- sqlite 4 250 250 50 .
```

Each run creates and removes a fresh temporary directory beneath the given directory; interruptions may leave a temporary directory behind. Use an appropriate measurement filesystem, not `/tmp` when it is RAM-backed. The harness initializes the data, warms up to 100 keys, and uses deterministic per-client random seeds. It prints completed operations, elapsed time, throughput, separate read/write p50/p95/p99, SQLite version, and configuration. An operation error fails the run rather than being omitted from the results. CI only smoke-tests that both paths execute.

This is a **closed-loop, in-process microbenchmark** with a small fixed-size value, not a production workload. It does not capture coordinated omission, CPU/RSS or I/O metrics, cold-start latency, multi-project fairness, power-loss behavior, PostgreSQL/MongoDB, service/network overhead, or independent durability validation. Record those separately, repeat tests under controlled conditions, and do not use this narrow result as a universal database ranking.

## Comparators

Start with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Turso Database on the same machine where their supported operations and safety settings are comparable. Later compare PostgreSQL- and MongoDB-compatible operations, then hosted APIs such as Neon, Cloudflare D1, and MongoDB Atlas as a separate category. An embedded function call is not equivalent to a remote authenticated API request.

## Workloads

- Single-key read, insert, overwrite, delete, and atomic increment once supported.
- Uniform and hot-key traffic; independent-key and same-key concurrent writes.
- Read-heavy, balanced read/update, and write-heavy mixes. Use [YCSB's published workload definitions](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads) where compatible.
- Datasets that fit in cache and datasets that exceed available memory; varied key/value sizes and project counts.
- Warm operation, cold reopen, burst traffic, noisy neighbors, and bounded overload.
- Corrupt/truncated files, process termination, recovery, and backup/restore correctness.
- Deterministic fault injection and replay of synthetic or explicitly permitted, privacy-reviewed traces; check correctness as well as timing on each replay.
- Relational transactions and document queries only when the candidate actually implements equivalent semantics. [TPC-C](https://www.tpc.org/tpcc/) is a later transactional reference; do not label a partial imitation an official TPC-C result.

## Measurement and fairness

Record code revision, engine versions, compiler settings, hardware, filesystem, memory limits, network path, dataset, query/index definitions, durability and replication settings, warm-up, concurrency, and repetitions. Report throughput, p50/p95/p99 latency, failures and timeouts, CPU, memory, disk I/O, recovery time, and correctness. Include bounded offered load and overload behavior, not only successful requests; avoid coordinated omission when assessing tail latency. Compare the same operation and consistency/durability guarantees, and report configuration differences instead of disabling safety to win a benchmark.

Publish the benchmark code, commands, raw results, and analysis. CI should check benchmark tooling for correctness, not enforce noisy shared-runner performance thresholds. Hardware-specific optimizations require a portable fallback and equivalent behavior tests.
