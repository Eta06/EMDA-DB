# Benchmark plan

No comparative performance results have been measured. The goal is to improve latency, throughput, scalability, and resource efficiency. **No performance optimization is accepted if it violates the durability, isolation, or recovery guarantees in force.** See the [storage and transaction contract](STORAGE_TRANSACTION_CONTRACT.md). No database can be assumed fastest at every operation or workload.

## Comparators

Start with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Turso Database on the same machine where their supported operations and safety settings are comparable. Later compare PostgreSQL- and MongoDB-compatible operations, then hosted APIs such as Neon, Cloudflare D1, and MongoDB Atlas as a separate category. An embedded function call is not equivalent to a remote authenticated API request.

## Workloads

- Single-key read, insert, overwrite, delete, and atomic increment once supported.
- Uniform and hot-key traffic; independent-key and same-key concurrent writes.
- Read-heavy, balanced read/update, and write-heavy mixes. Use [YCSB's published workload definitions](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Core-Workloads) where compatible.
- Datasets that fit in cache and datasets that exceed available memory; varied key/value sizes and project counts.
- Warm operation, cold reopen, burst traffic, noisy neighbors, and bounded overload.
- Corrupt/truncated files, process termination, recovery, and backup/restore correctness.
- Deterministic fault injection and replay of synthetic or explicitly permitted, privacy-reviewed traces; check correctness as well as timing on each replay.
- Relational transactions and document queries only when the candidate actually implements equivalent semantics. [TPC-C](https://www.tpc.org/tpcc/) is a later transactional reference; do not label a partial imitation an official TPC-C result.

## Measurement and fairness

Record code revision, engine versions, compiler settings, hardware, filesystem, memory limits, network path, dataset, query/index definitions, durability and replication settings, warm-up, concurrency, and repetitions. Report throughput, p50/p95/p99 latency, failures and timeouts, CPU, memory, disk I/O, recovery time, and correctness. Include bounded offered load and overload behavior, not only successful requests; avoid coordinated omission when assessing tail latency. Compare the same operation and consistency/durability guarantees, and report configuration differences instead of disabling safety to win a benchmark.

Publish the benchmark code, commands, raw results, and analysis. CI should check benchmark tooling for correctness, not enforce noisy shared-runner performance thresholds. Hardware-specific optimizations require a portable fallback and equivalent behavior tests.
